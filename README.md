<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About me</h3>

###

<p align="left">I'm a beginner programmer. I first became acquainted with the IT field at the STEP computer academy. There I became superficially acquainted with various areas in IT. I liked studying at the academy, so I decided to continue developing in this direction. And after 9th grade, I went to college to major in applied mathematics. In college we also studied various things, such as web development, C++, databases, etc. I also independently became acquainted with programming languages such as c#, java. I took a course in Java from ITVDN. I really liked the java language, so I continue to develop in this direction.</p>
